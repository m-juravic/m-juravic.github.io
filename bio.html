  <h1>About Maria</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Hello! Iâ€™m a former higher education professional looking forward to making a career change.
    After 20+ years working in higher education financial aid, I enrolled in Rithm's full-stack
    engineering program to jumpstart my career pivot to software engineering. I am very excited
    to build my fundamentals to kickstart a new career in software engineering!
  </p>
